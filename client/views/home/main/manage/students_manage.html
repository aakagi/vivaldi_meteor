        Once your students create an account at vivaldibeta.com, they will be able to add this class. When a student adds a class, you, the teacher, will first have to accept them as a student, by clicking on the 'confirm' button that will appear next to their name. You will also be able to deny students who are not in your class, and once everyone is fully signed up, you'll be able to 'lock' your class with the checkbox above, to keep other from being able to request to join your class.
